 *  * <p>
 *  * Her Offering
 *  * - Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF
 *  * - Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF

 *  * Extras:
 *  * - Extra milk 0.30 CHF
 *  * - Foamed milk 0.50 CHF
 *  * - Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF
 *  * Bonus Program
 *  * Charlene's idea is to attract as many regularâ€˜s as possible to have a steady turnaround.
 *  * She decides to offer a customer stamp card, where every 5th beverage is for free.
 *  * If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.
 *  * Your task is to:
 *  * Write a simple program whose output is formatted like a receipt you would receive at a supermarket.
 *  * The input to the program is a list of products the shopper wants to purchase (large coffee with extra milk, small coffee with special roast,
 *  * bacon roll, orange juice)
